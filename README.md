# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent diabetic retinopathy[1] among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct[2]. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness and affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more [3]. 
 
## Dataset Description
The data is collected from multiple clinics in Indian rural areas using fundus photography over an extended period of DR. The data source is from a Kaggle competition [4]. The public dataset size is 10G, consisting of a pre-split training set (3662 images and 1 outcome label) and a test set (1928 images). The private test set consisting of 20GB of data across 13,000 images. The outcome label is the severity of diabetic retinopathy rated by clinicians on a scale of 0 to 4. 
 
## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to train an image classifier to automatically identify diabetic retinopathy and provide information on the severity of the disease. We will follow a machine learning pipeline to conduct analysis:
